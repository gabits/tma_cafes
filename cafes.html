                            Les Deux Magots has been frequented by <b>many</b> famous writers and artists, such as
                            Simone de Beauvoir, Jean-Paul Sartre, Ernest Hemingway, Paul Verlaine, Arthur Rimbaud,
                            Pablo Picasso, Bertold Brecht and James Joyce. It has hosted historically many figures and
                            movements of artistic and <b>cultural impact</b> in its daily life.

                        <p>
                            Named after a theatrical play famous of the time, <span class="italic">Les Deux Magots de
                            la Chine</span> ("The Two Chinese Figurines"), the place was originally founded in 1812 as
                            a novelty shop in the Rue de Buci, where the majority of its fabrics sold were imported from
                            China.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 1873, the shop moved to the place <span class="italic">Saint-Germain-des-Prés</span> and
                            in 1884 transformed into a cafe. Nowadays it hosts literary prizes such as the musical
                            <span class="italic">Prix Pélleas</span> and the artistic <span class="italic">Prix
                            Saint-Germain</span>, but also the <span class="italic">Prix de Deux Magots</span>, founded
                            in 1933, as an alternative to the conservative ones, which has been impacting the parisien
                            cultural life ever since.

                            philosophers such as Pablo Picasso and Jean Paul-Sartre.

                        <p>
                            Localised in the <span class="italic">Boulevard du Montparnasse</span>, in the 6th
                            arrondissement, Las Closerie des Lilas is a beautiful and delicate cafe with a themed
                            decoration of nature and flowers. It has a <b>glass ceiling</b> and a
                            spacious outdoor patio, besides a surprisingly highly rated menu for plates and
                            desserts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Also known for having hosted many of <span class="italic">Ernest Hemingway</span>'s visits,
                            it's considered a refined and cozy place, although the prices might not be nearly as
                            attractive as the atmosphere. For a <b>glamour visit</b> to a cafe in
                            Paris, it might be an interesting choice with nice music and a marvellous environment to
                            appreciate a small meal around plants and contact with the outside.
