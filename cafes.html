                        <p>
                            Les Deux Magots has been frequented by <span class="italic">many</span> famous writers and
                            artists, such as Simone de Beauvoir, Jean-Paul Sartre, Ernest Hemingway, Paul Verlaine,
                            Arthur Rimbaud, Pablo Picasso, Bertold Brecht and James Joyce. It has hosted historically
                            many figures and movements of artistic and cultural impact in its daily life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Named after a theatrical play famous of the time, <span class="italic">Les Deux Magots de
                            la Chine</span> ("The Two Chinese Figurines"), the place was originally founded in 1812 as
                            a novelty shop in the Rue de Buci, where the majority of its fabrics sold were imported from
                            China.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 1873, the shop moved to the place Saint-Germain-des-Prés and in 1884 transformed into a
                            cafe. Nowadays it hosts literary prizes such as the musical Prix Pélleas and the artistic Prix
                            Saint-Germain, but also the Prix de Deux Magots, founded in 1933, as an alternative to the
                            conservative ones, which has been impacting the parisien cultural life ever since.

                        <p>
                            Right across Les Deux Magots, the Cafe de Flore is located in the 6th arrondissement, in the
                            Boulevard Saint-Germain. It has been functioning since the end of the 19th Century and in
                            this time it has attracted for decades remarkable artists and philosophers such as Pablo
                            Picasso and Jean Paul-Sartre.
                        </p>

                            Since 1994 Cafe de Flore has been hosting the literary prize <span class="italic">Prix de

                            series of essays on the parisien modern life, there's an essay dedicated to the popularity
                            and history of Cafe de Flore and Les Deux Magots, named <span class="italic">"A Tale of Two
                            Cafes"</span>, which analyses both cafes' popularity and the famous figures they have

                        <p>
                            Localised in the Boulevard du Montparnasse, in the 6th arrondissement, Las Closerie des Lilas
                            is a beautiful and delicate cafe with a themed decoration of nature and flowers. It has a glass
                            ceiling and a spacious outdoor patio, besides a surprisingly highly rated menu for plates and
                            desserts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Also known for having hosted many of Ernest Hemingway's visits, it's considered a refined
                            and cozy place, although the prices might not be nearly as attractive as the atmosphere.
                            For a glamour visit to a cafe in Paris, it might be an interesting choice with nice music
                            and a marvellous environment to appreciate a calm meal around plants and contact with the
                            outside.
